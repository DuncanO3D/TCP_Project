This is a TCP chat format. With a local host server.
You first need to launch a server and after you can connect with a client.

This is a personnal project for learn how to use the widonw socket system.

In the code you will find some UDP code, I write this for testing for a another personnel project.

Network Pure Files Path:
TCP:
ClientServer_TCP\Client.h
ClientServer_TCP\Client.cpp
ClientServer_TCP\Server.h
ClientServer_TCP\Server.cpp
UDP (Only server part, because the client is in a another project, this part was just a test tool for me):
ClientServer_TCP\Server_UDP.h
ClientServer_TCP\Server_UDP.cpp
